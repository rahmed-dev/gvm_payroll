feat: Make ESI Report components dynamic via Report Type field

Replace hard-coded component names with dynamic lookup based on
custom_report_type field in Salary Component.

Changes:
- ESI Report now queries components by Company + Report Type
- Removed hard-coded: "Basic Salary", "ESI - Employee Contribution", "ESI-Employer Contribution"
- Added validation with detailed error messages

Benefits:
- Multi-company support with different component names
- No code changes needed for component name variations
- User-configurable via Salary Component UI

Breaking Change:
- Requires Report Type field configuration on Salary Components
- Required values: "Basic", "ESI Employee", "ESI Employer"

Configuration: See CHANGELOG_ESI_REPORT.md
